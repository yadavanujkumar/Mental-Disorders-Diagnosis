# Mental-Disorders-Diagnosis

A comprehensive machine learning and deep learning project for diagnosing mental disorders based on patient symptoms and behavioral patterns.

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a complete data science pipeline including:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding the dataset through statistical analysis and visualizations
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - Intelligent pattern recognition and diagnosis prediction
- **Machine Learning (ML)** - Multiple traditional ML algorithms for classification
- **Deep Learning (DL)** - Neural networks for advanced pattern recognition

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains 120 patient records with 18 features including:
- Behavioral symptoms (Sadness, Euphoric, Exhausted, etc.)
- Sleep patterns
- Mood indicators
- Social behaviors
- Concentration levels
- Target variable: Expert Diagnose (Bipolar Type-1, Bipolar Type-2, Depression, Normal)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yadavanujkumar/Mental-Disorders-Diagnosis.git
cd Mental-Disorders-Diagnosis
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Analysis
